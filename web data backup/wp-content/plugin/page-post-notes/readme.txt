#### Help support us with a coffee donation

Donâ€™t you just hate it when you download a plugin and you find out that in order to use it you have to buy a pro version? 

Even bigger problem is when you use a plugin and then just out of the blue the developer decides to add a pro version and he either changes the way the plugin works or he converts some of the free functions to paid ones.

We sure did hate that and a few years back we decided to start creating some of the plugins ourselves and we decided to share them all with the WordPress community **100% FREE**. 

Nowadays we have more than 15 plugins and you can download and use them all for free by [Clicking Here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/yydevelopment/).

If you liked this plugin and you want to help support our cause, [buy us a coffee](https://www.yydevelopment.com/coffee-break/?plugin=page-post-notes). Studies show that coffee helps with creating WordPress plugins.
